Task 1 - Literature
1. Assigned paper: Edahiro, R., Shirai, Y., Takeshima, Y. et al. Single-cell analyses and host genetics highlight the role of innate immune cells in COVID-19 severity. Nat Genet 55, 753–767 (2023). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-023-01375-1
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-023-01375-1.
2. Answer the following questions
a. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
(1) ncMono is reduced in severe COVID-19 patients and exhibits abnormal cellular functions.
(2) IFN-γ response plays an important role in the severity of COVID-19.
(3) Host genetic risk is associated with the severity of COVID-19.
b. Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?
(1) Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
(2) Genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
(3) T Cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) sequencing
3. Further related research questions
a. List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that
extend the analysis presented in the paper.
(1) ncMono Is there a causal relationship between dysfunction and the severity of COVID-19, and what are the reasons for the decrease in ncMono? 
(2) Is the effect of IFNAR2 gene variation (rs13050728) on ncMono function clinically significant?
(3) In addition to ncMono and the IFN-γ signaling pathway, are there other immune cells or molecules involved in the severity of COVID-19, and how do they interact with ncMono?
